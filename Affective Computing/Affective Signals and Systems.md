# Affective Signals and Systems

This chapter overviews issues of representation in affective systems, specifically the need for a mixture of representations, spanning low to high levels of processing. Systems which can recognize, express and "have" emotions will employ processing both high-to-low and low-to-high transformations, from signal to symbo and vice-versa.

1. **Modeling an Affective System**
2. **A signal representation for emotions and moods**
3. **Ringing a bell**
4. **Property of response decay**
5. **Property of Repeated Strikes**
6. **Property of temperamental influence**
7. **Property of linearity and Time-Invariance**
8. **Property of Activation and Saturation**
9. **Property of Cognitive and Physical Feedback**
10. **Representing Mood**
11. **Physiological Signals**
	
	* There are many signals relevant to emotional responses that are physically measurable, especially by cameras, microphones, and sensors.
	* Patterns of low-level signls can be combined with high-level information to recognize an affective expression, as well as to charachterize an affective state.
	* The electromayogram (EMG) signal uses small elctrodes to measure a tiny voltage from a muscle indicating when it is contracted.
	* The blood volume pressure (BVP) signal is an indicator of blood flow, gathered using a technique known as photoplethysmography, which shines infrared light onto the skin and measures how much of it is reflected. The overall envelope of the signal tends to pinch when a person is startled, fearful or anxious. Am increase in BVP is observed when there is greater blood flow to the extremeties such as when a person relaxes.

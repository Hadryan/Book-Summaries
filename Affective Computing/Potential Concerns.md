# Potential concerns

This chapter raises several concerns of affective technology including the potential to mislead or deceive users, juvenile use of affect and emotionally unintelligent behavior, breaches of privacy, inaccuracies in recognition of affect etc.

1. **Expectations in interfaces**

	* Confront the special potential of affective computers to mislead people. It is important to help people set expectations about computer's abilities.
	* The source of any information affects people's reust in that information. In human-human communication, the trust placed in affective cues is understandable, since affective channels of communication are harder to fake. Consequently, we might expect that a computer's expression of affective cues also influences the perceiver's confidence in data.
	* However, when a computer can *recognize* the user's affective state but not *understand* it, how should the interface reflect.
	* A user's assumtions can simplify the demands on the computer program. This, though, has practical consequences while designing the system.

2. **Juvenile Beginnings**
	
	* An affective computer must not make juvenile responses.
	* However, there is likely to be a lot of poorly applied affect in the beginning e.g. machines with too much vocal inflection, agents that amuse you for the first week but annoy you a week later etc.
	* Poorly timed or overdone affect is worse than no affect.
	* Affective computing will be most succesful when the computer's emotions do not draw the user to itself.
	* Computers can be expected to appear juvenile at first, when thet are just learning to express affect.

3. **Human Privacy**

	* Affective computerscan gain access to our emotional lives - to information that is highly personal, intimate and private.
	* Emotional expression, once recognized by a computer can circulate over networks and trivially copied and sold, unless protected by firewalls, encryption etc.

4. **Accuracy, Lie Detection and Computer Objectivity**
	
	* The accuracy with which people recognize emotion is called *receiving accuracy* in parlance of psychology. The accuracy with which you express emotions so that it is correctly received is called sending accuracy.
	* We want both these acciracies to be high for a computer to succeed in recognizing emotions.
	* People's tendency to believe in computers as being objective is a subte danger. 
	* A person's own mood influences his perception. However, when computers are used in evaluating physiological information, people tend to trust the computer's report. 
	* This bias is generally present in medical instrumentation, despite the fact that it is designed by people. People tend to trust more those things that can be measured quantitatively.
	* However, computers, even if unbiased by emotion are biased by their programmers and by what they have learned. *Emotional or not, computers are not purely objective.*

5. **Symmetry in Communication**
	
	* A form of symmetry similar to video teleconferencing should be considered for computers that can recognize our emotions. You should have the ability to see what emotions your computer is recognizing from you. 
	* When physiological signals are communicating affective information, it is safe to first convert them in a format that is natural for communicating affect - mediated by faces, voices, gestures etc. 
	* They are not only meaningful but can also avoid the potential harm of closely coupled biofeedback.
	* Emotional intelligence also enters into decision of how the computer communicates to you what it is recognizeing. For e.g. if you have asked it to assist you with stress reduction or dealing with anger, they you will want it to not only recognize these events but have sensitive ways of calling them to your attention.

6. **Computers acting emotionally**
	
	* Can we create computers that will recognize and express affect, exhibit creativity, intelligent proble solving, and empathy and never bring about harm by emotional actions? Can we have the good, without the bad?
	* Computers will atleast have to regulate their emotions, to maintain a balanced operation.
	* Mechanisms corresponding to negative emotions play important roles in a computer's ongoing adaptation to its complex and changing environment.
	* The important question is not what emotions will a computer have, but what emotional behaviors will it be capable of  and how will it choose to regulate these?
	* Computers will have to go through rigorous tests to prove their abilities before being put in positions of authority.

7. **Who or What is responible**
	
	* It is imperative that himans take responsibility for everything computers do. *Humans must be in command of human-machine systems.* As a corollary: *Machines must be predictible*
	* However, creativity and flexibility are considered necessary components of intelligence but creativity seems to imply *unpredictibility.*
	* The "Three Laws of Robotics" by Issac Asimov can be reproduced here, but with "robot" replaced by "computer" so that it can apply to any computational entity:
		- A computer may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
		- A computer must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
		- A computer must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
	* These laws put human life above the self-preservation of the computer. However laws are not infallible.
	* A computer that has the concept of freedom and that can have goals and desires might desire freedom. It might also interpret its laws, or be willing to disregard them for something it thinks is greater.

8. **Computer Rights?**
	
	* *Freedom comes to those who can speak for it, fight for it and die for it. Or to those for whom others speak up, fight or die.*
	* With or without "life", when computers give the appearance of having emotions, then they are likely to arouse the feelings and concerns of humans for them.
	* It is not unlikely that similar to animals or possibly greater rights will be demanded for computers at some point.
	* Giving computers emotions is adding heat to the fires of any future activists who might favor machine liberty. (*The activists might probably be computers.*)

9. **Considerations for the Computer Designer**
	
	* As designers, we may or may not choose to give affective computers abilities that closely mimic humans. For e.g.:
		- Privacy. Should computers be allowed to keep their emotions hidden from each other? From other humans> From their human designer(s)
		- Multiple channels. Should computers have seperate channels of expression corresponding to expressions of the will vs. spontaneous expression? More than two channels, perhaps with different roles?
		- Valence. Should what is considered good or bad be hard-wired or learned. And how will it be ensured that these valences are consistent with society's morals?
		- Contagtion. Should computers be able to catch the mood of another computer? Or human?
		- Awareness. Most people are not *always* aware of their emotions; should conscious awareness in computers be similar?
		- Hijacking. Fast primary emotions in humans can fire in the presence of snakes, spiders, threats to self or loved one etc., hijacking cortical reasoning. If computers have such mechanisms, what should trigger them?
		- Emotion range. What range of emotions is needed for which tasks? For example, do computers ever need to feel misery? Contempt? Anger?
	* Should computer emotions be designed differently? If yes, then how?
	* Should humans have unequivocal access to read internal synthesized computer states?
	* A possible preventive steps for disasters and miscommunication (wrt affective computers) would be to prohibit the machine from hiding its emotions.
	* The greater the freedom of a machine, the more it will need moral standards.
	* Feeling of significance is believed to be at the root of many of the influences emotion has on memory and cognitive functions.
	* Feeling s provide a mechanism for efficient;y alerting and biasing both our subconscious processes and conscious self to what is important. Like control signals, feelings can both carry information and guide other processes in how to respond.
	* It is possible to give computers all othe components of emotions described, however this presupposes that computers have consciousness, which as explained earlier, is not assured.

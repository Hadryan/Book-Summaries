# Emotion Synthesis

This chapter describes emotion synthesis, specifically focusing on models that employ both cognitive and non-cognitive mechanisms for generating emotion. Cognitively generated emotions have been the easiest to implement in AI systems, as emotion theories are usually described with rules and lend themselves directly to rule-based implemntation in a computer. This chapter also describes various ways to synthesize emotion's influence on other processes: both cognitive and physical.

Emotions implemented in agents today are primarily cognitively generated. Furthermore, they have mostly been used only for entertainment purposes instead of using emotions to help manage information overload, regulate prioritization of activities, and make decisions more flexibly, creatively, and intelligently. This is a fine ue, and valuable for many applications, but it should not be the the only use.

1. **Emotion Synthesis via Cognitive Mechanisms**

	- **The Ortory Clore Collins (OCC) Cognitive Model**
		- In 1988 Ortony, Clore and Collins published their book, *The Cognitive Structure of Emotions*, setting forth a model of cognitive appraisal for emotions that has come to be called the *OCC* model.
		- They believed that AI systems must be able to *reason about* emotions- especially for natural language understanding, cooperative problem solving, and planning.
		- The OCC model addresses the problem of representing emotions by grouping emotions, according to cognitive eliciting conditions.
		- It assumes that emotions arise from valenced reactions to situations consisting of events, agents, and objects.

2. **Emotion Synthesis via Multiple Mechanisms**
		The OCC and Roseman theories provide a rule-based mechanism for cognitive generation of emotions. However, in humans, emotions are generated not only by explicit reasoning, but also by low-level noncognitive influences. This section descibes three models which encompass not only cognitive reasoning for generating emotion, but also additional low-level mechanisms, inspired by human emotion system.
		- **Four Elicitors for Emotion Synthesis**
			- Carroll Izard (Izard, 1993) proposed that there are four types of elicitors of emotions in humans as below:
				- *Neural* : Effect of neurotransmitter and other neurochemical processes. These processes run independently, in the background, and are influenced by hormones, sleep, diet, depression medication, etc.
				- *Sensorimotor* : Effect of posture, facial expression, muscular tension, and other central efferent activity. These effects primarily intensify a given emotional state, but in some cases appear to be capable of generating new affective states.
				- *Motivational* : Effect of sensory provocations such as anger provoked by paon, of drives such as hunger, and emotions evoking each other.
				- *Cognitive* : Effect of cortical reasoning, implemented here via an adaption of Roseman's theory.
			- Emotional behaviors compete for control, with the value of each beahvior determined by a linear combination of *releasing mechanisms.*
			- It is an important first step toward development of a complete computational emotion system.

3. **Synthesizing Emotion's Influences**
		- **Realizing Multiple Concerns**
		- **Emotions influencing learning and behavior**
		- **Affective Decision making**
		- **Emotions that interact with memory**	
			- The same emotion that influences a person's learning and decision making also influences memory retrieval and a host of other cognitive processes.
			- Good feelings likely enocode knowledge of effectiveness, familiarity, opportunity, and associations with positive outcomes. Bad feelings likely encode knowledge of ineffectiveness, unfamiliarity, risk, and associations with bad outcomes.
			- When it is time to take decisions, valenced feelings help bias a person away from bad outcomes and toward good ones. 
			- Studies of patients with prefrontal brain damageshow, these biasing mechanisms are apparently at work *before* declarative knowledge for reasoning is activated.

4. **Emotion as an umbrella**
		- Human emotion system consists of many different components, and not all emotions use all the components in the same way. For e.g., to implement low-level fear, we need crude pattern recognition and fast responses capable of hijacking other cognitive responses.

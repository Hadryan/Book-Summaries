# Applications of Affective Computing

This chapter suggests applications of affective computing in entertainment, learning, social development, preventive medicine, consumer relations and seceral other areas. Given an ability that already exists in humans, then it is only a matter of time and effort before the same ability can be imitated in computers. Note that while the book suggests a lot of applications, I list down the ones I found the  most interesting.

1. **Affective Mirror**:
	- A virtual agent that watches your facial expressions and body language, sensing changes in psychological parameters such as your skin conductivity and temperature etc. helping you to see how you appear in various situations. This use of affect recognition is one of many ways in which affective computing might be used by people who waould like to advance their own interactive skills.

2. **Beyond Emoticons**:
	- If you send an imparttial email to someone, and somebody who reads it is in a negative mood, then they are biased to receive it as if it were a negative message. This is because human perception is often influenced by mood. When sentic modulation is missing in affect-limited forms of communication like Email, misunderstandings occur more often.
	- Tools that recognize and express affect can be used to expand affective bandwidth of emails. For e.g. a voice with inflection could read your email to you. The interface could change its look and feel to signify tone. 
	- An agent that could discern your affect either directly from you, or from previewing the text you are about to send, might alert you of the tone of the text before you send it, so that you could glance at the valence that a recipient might sense upon reading it.

3. **Text to speech**:
	- An estimated 25 million people (at the time of writing the book) in the world are without effective speech communication, and potentially could use computers to convert text to speech- synthesiing a voice to assist or replace their own. 
	- One of the problems with text-to-speech systems is that they say everything in the same tone of voice. This makes it difficult to communicate feelings: to interrupt angrily, to express anxious concern, to indicate empathy etc.
	- Affective computing can be applied to this problem.
	- One of the problems with adding affect to a text-to-speech system is the interface: people talk much faster than they type.
	- Computer can try to recognize the speaker's affect from his or her bodily expression. In other words, bodily sentic modulation can control the affect in the synthetic speech. For e.g. when speaker's temperature and blood pressure climb in anger, her synthetic voice could adjust itself to sound more angry. 
4. **Helping Autistic People**
	- Most autistic people have the difficulty with emotional understanding- they lack emotional intelligence, especially empathy and an understanding of suitable responses in an emotional situation.
	- They have difficulty generalizing from one pattern to another, and from one situation to another.
	- There is a great need for computer tools that could help autistics develop emotional skills- tools that iteratively and patiently walk them through scenario after scenario, helping them learn to draw analogies and generaliations, especially of situations in which emotions are likely to arise.
	- Computers with an ability to teach this understanding-via games, exploratory words, virtual social scenarios, and other interactions that provide repetitive reinforcement, could be developed with present technology.
	- Computers should also be able to recognize the emotional expressions of an autistic user, to help him give feedback as he tries to learn skills such as empathy.
	-(**Intersting challenge**) It is not clear if it would be good for the computer to also *have* emotions. Emotions might interfere with the advantage computers have of being able to engage indefinitely in highly repetitive tasks, unless the emotions were set to mimic extraordinary patience.
5. **Emotions in learning**:
	- As learning increases in difficulty, one may experience confusion, frustration, or anxiety which can lead to abandon learning.
	- Computers that cannot recognize human affect are severely handicapped in a role such a teacher or mentor.
	- One of the (then) ongoing research problems in adaptive feedback is determining at which points to give feedback so that it is not derailing to the user. 
	- To complicate matters, the answer to this question will be user-dependent. Experienced teachers say it is important to detect the level of engagement and level of frustration of a student.
	- Offering help that can interrupt user's engagement can be disruptive, while acknowledging the user's frustration, even subtly can encourage perseverance.

6. **"Fast forwrd to interesting part"**:
	- Helping computers see as people see.
	- Tools that aid consumers and filmamkers in retrieving and editing video. E.g. "Fast forward to dinosaur scene."
	- A much harder goal is to "make the long story short."
	- These new challenges are the ones where cross-discipline between cognitive science, emotion theory, and computer science are sorely needed.
	- The problem of locating a remembered scene or with a particularly interesting content is a problem of understanding causes of arousal.
	- Arousal (excited/calm) has been found to be a better predictor of memory retention than valence(pleasure/displeasure).
	- Affective annotations, especially in terms of a few basic emotions or a few dimensions of emotions, could provide a relatively compact and salient index for retrieval of data. For example, instead of annotating, "this is a sunny daytime shot of a student getting diploma and jumping off the stage", the human might annotate "this shot of a student getting his diploma nd jumping off the stage *evokes a grin*."

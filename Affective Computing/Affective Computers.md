# Affective Computers

This chapter discusses about emotional development and computers that recognize, express, have emotions and have emotional intelligence. It also dicusses the design criteria and tests they have to pass and examines the difference between emotions in computers and humans.

1. **Developing Emotions**:
	- We must know and understand how to develop an ability that we want a computer to have. 
	- If computers act stupidly when they first become affective, it will be because their designers have not given them the ability to act intelligently with emotions.
	- An affective computer will need a development process (similar to that of a human) whereby it acquires knowledge relevent to its affective and other abilities.
	- It will need both an innate set of abilities as well as tools to continually learn new ones.(reach adulthood in terms of affective abilities)
	- Every computer doesn't need all of the affective abilities all of the time.
2. **Computers that Recognize Emotions**
	Computers can sense and recognize and use its knowledge about the situation and emotion recognition to infer the underlying emotional state which most likely gave rise to the expressions.
	* Evaluating Affect recognition
		- Test for computer to evaluate its recognition ability: Competition between humans and computers to recognize the emotions expressed by a person in a digital video.
		- Two modes:
			- Person Dependent: Computer already knows the person in the video. 
			- Person Independent: Computer doesn't know the person and uses generic recognition abilities
		- Computer recognition of computer emotion may also become important
	* Differences in Human and Computer Recognition
		- Computers might recognize emotions and other states that humans would not ordinarily recognize. E.g. through sensitive hearing and infrared vision
		- It is possible for computers to recognize affective states that presently do not have names.
	* Affect recognition, without other Affective Abilities?
		- For computer recognition to imitate human recognition, computers also need to imitate the influence of mood.
		- Computers need to be a bit emotional savvy to recognize whether or not a situation calls for sincere expressions or masking of one's true feelings.
	* Summary of criteria of recognition:
		- Input: Face, Voice, Hand signals
		- Pattern Recognition: Feature extraction and classification
		- Reasoning: Predicts underlying emotions
		- Learning
		- Bias- The emotional state of the computer (if it has emotions) influences its recognition of ambiguous emotions
		- Output: Names the recognized expressions
3. **Computers that Express Emotions**
	The basic requirement for a computer to be able to express emotions is that the machines have channels of communication such as voice or image and an ability to comunicate affective information over those channels.(e.g Macintosh's smile on booting up). We might describe the affective bandwidth of a channel as how much affective information the channel lets through.
	* Evaluating Affect Expression
		- Test 1: Make the computers express emotions and make humans recognize it(Clark Elliot)
		- Test 2: Test computer's ability to *induce* emotion, by contagion
	* Differences in Human and Computer Expression
		- A computer will need to know when to be subtle in its emotional expression
		- Computers can express emotions but not have emotions. Such is never the case with humans (naturally)
		- (**Interesting**) Intentional vs Spontaneous emotions in computers
	* Affect expression, without other Affective Abilities?
		- Computer can simply act as an unemotional channel for transmission of human emotions
		- There is a bias-exclusion affect that impacts the systems which can both express and have emotions.
	* Summary of criteria for Expression:
		- Input: Instructions telling what emotion(s) to express
		- Intentional vs Spontaneous Pathways
		- Feedback: Affective State can influence expresions and vice versa
		- Bias-Exclusion: It is easiest to express current affective state and it can make the expression of other affective states difficult
		- Social Display Rules
		- Output: Voice Modulation, Animated face, Music, Background colors etc.
4. **Computers that *Have* Emotions
	* *Can Machines feel?*( How are humans then different from machines?)
	* What does it mean for a computer to have emotions? Prof. Picard proposes an answer by describing 5 components of a sysytem that has emotions. We can say that a computer "has emotions" when all 5 components are present
	* Component 1: Emergent Emotions and Emotional Behavior
		-Emergent Emotions: Emotions based on the observable behavior especially without any internal mechanism that produces emotions
		- Toda talks about urges which are motivational subroutines linking cognition to action
		- Urges can be *emergency urges* and *social urges*
		- Urges are trigerred in relevant situations and subsequently influence cognitive processes, attention and bodily arousal.
	* Component 2: Fast Primary Emotions
	* Component 3: Congnitively Generated Emotions
	* Component 4: Emotional Experience
	* Component 5: Body-Mind Interactions
	* Although all the components are present in a complete emotional system, they don't all need to be activated at all times
	* Evaluating performance
	* Computers with Minds and Bodies
	* Emotions and Consciousness
5. **Systems that have Emotional Intelligence**
	A computer with emotional intelligence will be the one skilled at understanding and expressing its own emotions, recognizing emotions in others, regulating affect, using moods for adaptive behaviors.
	* 3 main domains of emotional intelligence:
		- Recognition and expression of emotions
		- Regulating emotions
		- Utilizing emotions
	* Until computers can learn the emotional significance and similarities of situations, they will be only good at memorizing pattrns but not good at understanding emotional significance
	* Evaluating Emotional Intelligence
		- Standardized test of human emotional intelligence is virtually nonexistent
		- True test of emotional intelligence for computers requires unpredictable interactions with humans or other agents
	* Differences in Human and Emotional Intelligence
		- Criteria for both computer and emotional intelligence are almost same except in the experience of emotions required for empathy.
		- we cannot expect a machine to really feel what we feel, even if it *has* emotions.
		- Difference in social display rules
		- Computer emotional health(Interesting)
	* Beyond Emotional Intelligence
	Any application involving an affective computer will require attention to following 3 issues:
		- What is the relevant set of emotions for this application?
		- How can these be best recognized/expressed/developed?
		- How should a computer respond to the user given this information
		- Affective computing should be seen as a critical part of intelligent systems but by no means the only part
6. **Imitating vs Duplicating**
	- Are computer emotions real or just a simulation?
	- If all the five components acn be inculcated in a system, then computers can be said to duplicate the inputs and outputs. This duplication will not necessarily hold at any other level, but ath the level it holds, a computer may said to have emotional abilities.

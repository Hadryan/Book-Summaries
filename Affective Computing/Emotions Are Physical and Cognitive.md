# Emotions Are Physical and Cognitive

This chapter emphasizes on two aspects of emotions: physical and cognitive.

1. **Physical vs. Cognitive:**
	- The thories on emotions can be examines in terms of two components:
		- Mental Component: Emotions are cognitive
		- Bodily Component: Emotions are physical
	- Development of affective computers requires understanding of both physical and cognitive components of emotion
	- If a computer is trying to recognize or understand your emotion, it should be able to get information not just by you telling it the name of the emotion but also by looking at your face, listening to your voice, noticing your gestures etc.
	- Research emphasizes that the physiological responses, viz. increasing heart rate, hands perspiring, that co-occur with an emotion immidiately follows it.
	- Schachter and Singer argued that the experience of physiological changes was not sufficient to discriminate emotions.
	- According to them, same state of bosily arousal can be achieved in different situtaions.
	- So, brain must appraise the situation we are in before it labels the state with an emotion.
2. **Physical Aspects of Emotion-Sentic Modulation:** 
		- The influence of emotion on bodily expression has been termed as Sentic Modulation in the book.
		- It's the physical means by which an emotional state is typically expressed and primary means of human communication.
		- To give computers affect recognition requires understanding of physical manifestations of emotion.
	* Facial Expression:
		- Paul Ekman terms facial expressions as social display of rules
		- Presently most attempts to automate recognition of facial expressions are based on Ekman's Facial Action Coding system (provides mapping between muscles and an emotion space)
	* Vocal Intonation:
		- The challenge for affective computers is to understand **how** something is said
		- Also important in applications where people and computers depend upon the use of synthetic voices
	* Motor forms of Expression:
		- Alternate forms of Sentic Modulation have been esplored by Clynes (1977)
		- Sentic Equivalence allows a person to select an arbitrary motor output of

3. **Cognitive Aspects:**
	* Primary vs Secondary Emotions
	* Developing and Learning Emotions
	* Complicating Conditions
	* Emotions and Creativity
	* Emotions and Memory
	* Intentional vs. Spontaneous smiles

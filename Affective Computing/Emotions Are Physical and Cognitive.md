# Emotions Are Physical and Cognitive

This chapter emphasizes on two aspects of emotions: physical and cognitive.

1. **Physical vs. Cognitive:**
	- The thories on emotions can be examines in terms of two components:
		- Mental Component: Emotions are cognitive
		- Bodily Component: Emotions are physical
	- Development of affective computers requires understanding of both physical and cognitive components of emotion
	- If a computer is trying to recognize or understand your emotion, it should be able to get information not just by you telling it the name of the emotion but also by looking at your face, listening to your voice, noticing your gestures etc.
	- Research emphasizes that the physiological responses, viz. increasing heart rate, hands perspiring, that co-occur with an emotion immidiately follows it.
	- Schachter and Singer argued that the experience of physiological changes was not sufficient to discriminate emotions.
	- According to them, same state of bosily arousal can be achieved in different situtaions.
	- So, brain must appraise the situation we are in before it labels the state with an emotion.
2. **Physical Aspects of Emotion-Sentic Modulation:** 
		- The influence of emotion on bodily expression has been termed as Sentic Modulation in the book.
		- It's the physical means by which an emotional state is typically expressed and primary means of human communication.
		- To give computers affect recognition requires understanding of physical manifestations of emotion.
	* Facial Expression:
		- Paul Ekman terms facial expressions as social display of rules
		- Presently most attempts to automate recognition of facial expressions are based on Ekman's Facial Action Coding system (provides mapping between muscles and an emotion space)
	* Vocal Intonation:
		- The challenge for affective computers is to understand **how** something is said
		- Also important in applications where people and computers depend upon the use of synthetic voices
	* Motor forms of Expression:
		- Alternate forms of Sentic Modulation have been esplored by Clynes (1977)
		- Sentic Equivalence allows a person to select an arbitrary motor output of sufficeint degrees of freedom for expressing emotion.
		- E.g. Sentograph measures pressure along two degrees of freedom - vertical pressure and horizontal deflection -form a person pushing with a finger on the device while expressing an emotion.
		- Essentic form is a precise **saptiotemporal form** produced by the nervous system, which carries the emotional message (like one represented by sentograph)
		-Through essentic forms, emotions can be communicated by many means, not just facial and vocal expression.
		- Stable distinct traces for states such as no emotion, anger, hate, grief, love, joyu,reverence etc. have been provided by this form of emotional expression (Clynes, 1977)
		- Deliberate expressions can differ from spontaneous or naturally generated exoression and so the distinctions can be blurred
	* Other Physiological Responses
		- Many physiological responses vary with time and can be potentially combined to assist in the recognition of emotional states (e.g. heart rate, pupilary dilation, pulse, respiration, skin conductance and color and temperature)
		- Responses Apparent to others:
			* Facial Expression
			* Vocal Intonation
			* Gestures
			* Posture
			* Pupilary Dilation
		- Less Apparent to others
			* Respiration
			* Heart Rate
			* Temperature
			* Electrodermal response
			* Muscle action potentials
			* Blood Pressure
		- E.g. Given feelings of joy, the voice might go up in pitch, the face reveal a smile, finger pressure might have a slight bounce like character
		- Affective computers equipped with cameras, microphones, physiological sensors, and sophisticated pattern recognition tools, can begin to recognize physiological components of emotion.
	* Complicating Conditions
		- Most emotions do not map to a fixed sentic modulation all the time.
		- Factors complicating the mapping between emotions and their expression: 	
			* Intensity of the emotion
			* Type of emotion, e.g. there are many types of love
			* How was the state induced (Virtual experience, Real experience, Vicarously etc.)
			* Social display rules (was the person supposed to express or suppress emotions)
		- A mood-state cues memories that are consistent with that mood: positive moods tend to make it easier to remember positive things and negative moods tend to make it easier to remember negative things	
	* Person Independent Emotion Recognition
		- Different individuals may express same emotions differently (One person's feet may perspire when he is nervous while other person's hand may perspire)
		- Temperament and personality gives clues to these patterns of expression
		- The sine qua non for emotion should not be a unique pan-cultural signal- Ekman
		- This situation parallels with signal processing problem of constructing "speaker-independent" speech recognition systems( diffrence in accent, pitch etc.)
		- A solution to this can be a personal computer that is trained on an individual or on someone who responds and expresses like the concerned individual.
		- The affect recognition problem can be poised as a computer learning and pattern recognition problem, to determine which features are the best predictors for each context.
		- If we consider an "universal" recognizer, then it would be trained on features that are similar across individuals. It would train itself on various categories which individuals can belong to.
3. **Cognitive Aspects:**
	* Primary vs Secondary Emotions
		- Cognitive appraisal can precede the generation of emotions.
		- Primary - There are certain features of stimuli that we respond to emotionally first, and that activate a corresponding cognitive state secondarily, e.g. Startle upon hearing a loud bang
		- Secondary - Emotions that arise later in an individual's development when systematic connections are identified between emotions and situation, e.g. Grief
		- Secondary emotions can be initiated merely by cognitive thoughts
	* Developing and Learning Emotions
		- The cortical involvement in secondary emotions is hypothesized to help generalize primary emotional response
		- Cortical limbic links can work in either directions, attaching feelings to thoughts or thoughts to feelings (method acting)
	* Complicating Conditions
		- Several of the factors mentioned earlier that complicate physiological studies of emotions also complicate cognitive studies of emotion
		- Problems in cognitive studies of emotion in laboratory, where subjects are asked to verbalize their emotional state, as opposed to or in addition to being physically measured.
		- Cognitive interpretation of the environment
		- Scientists haven't yet found how people arrive at the valenced decisions of good vs bad etc. (Note that this could have been changed since the book was written in 1997)
		- Cognitively generated emotions are often not expressed in readily observable waysbut may occur in thoughts.
		- **Science might be able to find a process of recovering somebody's thoughts by looking at various brain signals produced while thinking those thoughts: Inverse Problem (goal is to invert the signal generation process to reconstruct the thoughts that gave rise to the fignals **) (Extremely Difficult but Extremely interesting)
	* Emotions and Creativity
		- Cognitive mechanisms of creativity are not very well understood
		- Is there a link between emotions and creativity? If yes, one would expect highly creative people to exhibit greater emotionality.
		- Poets and writers (Lord Tennyson, William Blake) wote about the extreme mood swings they endured.
		- Ernest Hemongway, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton etc. were hospitalized for either mania or depression.
		- Scientists have documented a correlation between these effects
		- High occurence of alcoholism points to limbic seat of emotions and its link to creativity
		- Alcohol suppresses cortical activity which enhances blood flow in limbic system and increases emotional fluidity.
	* Emotions and Memory
		- Memory enters into nearly every cognitive task
		- Effect of mood on evaluative judgement: in the study of Forgas and Moylan, viewers of a movie made judgements about the questions of political figures, personal lives, future events reflecting the movie they had seen. No such bias was found among those entering the theatre.
		- Positive moods tend to make it easier to remember positive things and same goes with negative moods and negative things.
		- Memory may be the chief mechanism through which emotions enter into the mental associations active in analogical thinking and creativity.
	* Intentional vs. Spontaneous smiles
		- Neurological studies indicate that true emotions travel their own special path to the motor system.
		- (**Interesting observation**) If the neurologist asks a patient who is paralyzed on one side to smile, then only one side of the patient's mouth rises. But when the neurologist cracks a funny joke, then a natural two sided smile appears.
		For facial expressions, it is widely accepted that the will and emotions control seperate paths (Ekman, 1990)
4. **Inducement of Emotions**
	- Most frequent example of mood inducement is choosing of forms of entertainment. We enjoy selecting a recording that affects our mood in a particular way
	- Theorists have postulated that the sensory feedback from muscle movements, such as a smile, is suffeicient to induce corresponding emotion.
	- Boody-mind reinforcement may provide subliminal ways to induce emotion
	- As computers develop affective abilities, they potentially amy be used for both helpful and harmful purposes.

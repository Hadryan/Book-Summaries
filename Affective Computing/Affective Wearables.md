# Affective Wearables

This chapter describes affective wearable computers that are with you over long periods of time, like clothing and that are therefore potentially able to build up long-term models of your expressions and preferences. Affective wearables offer new ways to augment human abilities, such as assisting the speaking-impaired, and helping remember important information that was preceived. They could help people identify stress and provide feedback as people try to find healthier responses, working in concert with body's own immune system. Computers excel at amassing information and their ability to analyze and identify patterns is being improved rapidly. Given a willingness on the part of a wearer to share this information with scientific researchers, a wealth of important data could be gathered for furthering theories of learning, intelligence, perception, diet, mental health and many more.
1. **Consumer Wearables**
	Let us consider two future examples of affective wearables:
	a. **Augmenting Human Memory**
		- The human brain has its own interesting "do not forget" button, despite the fact that most of us do not have eidetic memory. 
		- When a human is exposed to an emotionally significant event, the memory of it is especially crisp and clear., even if it is not entirely accurate. This phenomenon is called "flashbulb memory".
		- An affective *WearCam* (wearable camera) can automatically "remember" visual events of emotional significance to its wearer. 
		- However, people's preferences change all the time. Adapting to fickle desires of users is a challenging problem.
		- An affective WearCam will show you a mediated reality, that is you'll see what the camera sees. For example, an artist might use mediated reality tpo see the world in black and white panorama, or in enhanced-contrast. A person might see the world differently based on her heart rate or her level of fear. The system might exaggerate the influences of emotion on perception- to literally let the wearer see the world through *rose colored glasses* or through *tunnel vision.*
		- The use of affect can be used not only to augment visual memory but a *rememberance agent* in your wearable working with typed text (Bradley Rhodes and Thad Starner), helps in retrieving associated ideas and information.
		- However a software agent that has access to the networks could share the information about your interests and preferances with just about anybody. The design of the system should ensure the protection of privacy of the same.
	b. **Digital Disc Jockey**
		- An affective personal disk jockey would be a system that selects music for an individual, considering a variety of personal factors.
		- The system would try to recognize if you like a song or not and try to find out why.
		- The personal DJ would notice patterns or your habits and download several appropriate choices of songs based on your situation and musical taste.

	These two examples of affective wearables illustrate how the tools of affective computing can be combined with personal technology. In both example a common consumer product communicates with sensors and pattern aanlysis software gradually learns what you like/dislike just from being around you and watching how you respond. 

2. **Prototype of an Affective Wearble Computer**
	- Jennifer Healey, a research assistant at the MIT Media Lab, along with Prof. Picard had been working to build an affective wearable computer (at the time of writing the book).
	- When a person wears the system, no wires or sensors need to be visible (they can be hidden under clothing). In future, many of the sensors may work wirelessly and be configures into clothing and jewelry.
	- Input from sensors can be displayed on a  *Private Eye Screen*. The wearer enters annotations such as "begin work", "end work" etc. with a single-handed device that allows her to type words by pressing "chords" of keys. The annotations are automatically time stamped by the system and stored to a log file. The computer can gather both affective and non-affective information.
	- The goal should not be to control people or tell them what to do. Instead such a system would only be worn in a voluntary mode for reasons of benefit to the wearer.
	- **Technology, Interface and Human Factors Issues**
		- A need particular to affective wearables is development of robust sensirs with reliable contact and communications.
		- It is desirable to weave necessary sensors into forms such as rings, bands with which people are already in contact with.
		- Wearable systems need to be carefully designed not to annoy their wearers.

3. **Out of the Lab and into the World**
	- One of the problems with sensing affective states is that involves knowing what your typical range of responses is, before they can tell if how you are responding is unusual.
	- The best way to learn how your body behaves throughout your ordinary day-to-day routine is to have the wearable collect information as you go about the routone.
	- *A few visits to the laboratory for monitoring are not as informative as a system that can accompany you outside the lab*
	- Another need is for the wearable to perceive your context. A machine that *perceives context* is one that recognizes where you are, what time it is, who you are with and, ideally, what situation you are in.
	- If a computer is going to learn a user's preferences, it is going to have to be proactive about it.
	- Strong emotions provide triggers for learning something new. For example, if the wearable detects that you get frustrated looking for your eyeglasses or car keys, then it should memorize what they look like and note their locations every time you put them somewhere.
	- Implicit in this are three scenarios:
		- The computer perceives your context and situation
		- The computer is affective
		- The computer learns relationship between context, situation and your affective responses.
	- A blend of rudimentary perceptual, affective and cognitive abilities is necessary to make such intelligent personal computers.

4. **Emotion Theory for Ambulatory People**
	- People's emotional patterns depend on the context in wgich they are elicited.
	- Problems with studies of emotion in a lab setting, especially with interference from cognitive social rules, are well documented. But the ideal study to aid the development of emotion theory is real-life observation.
	- Affective wearables provide a significant opportunity to bring powerful computational methods to bear on testing emotion theories, permitting data to be collected from people as they engage in natural and social interactions.

5. **Anxiety on the Move**
	- Sensing physiological patterns is not a new thing; ambulatory medical devices have been under development for years, helping people with various medical complications to monitor their heart rate, blood pressure etc. 
	- Affective wearbles overlab with medical wearbles in that both may sense physiological signals. In particular both may be concerned with sensing signals that indicate stress, anxiety, chronic anger or depression with a goal of helping people suffereing from these.
	- Affective pattern recognition techniques can be marshed to identify physilogical patterns important for elucidating the underlying mechanisms responsible for many affect related mental disorders including anxiety, panic attacks, and post traumatic stress disorders.
	- Affective wearbles migh also act as an amplifier for communication or as an affect transducer to allow emotion to control some other process in efforts to impove their mental health.
	
6. **Intimacy and Privacy**
	- Computers come with cameras and microphones, potentially ready to see our facial expressions and listen to our intonation. They are in a unique position to sense our affective state. 
	- This opens new communication possibilities including transmission of moods. The agent could gather data and have information ready for you if asked for assistance.
	- However, privacy is a priorirty with afective wearables. It is important to insure that the wearer reatins ultimate control over the devices he chooses to wear, so that **they are tools of helpful empowerment and not harmful subjugation.** 
	- Even when choosing a method of cryptography, users will need to exercise caution, such as by emoloying a solution where they holds the cryptographic key as opposed to some outside organization.

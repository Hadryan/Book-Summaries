Picard, with this book proposes that we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand and better yet, have and express emotions if we want them to be genuinely intelligent and to interact with us in a natural manner.

She provides scientific explainations and findings that indicate the essential role that emotions play in decision making, learning etc. The book has been written in two parts: **Part I** provides the intellectual framework for affective computing. It includes background on human emotions, requirements for emotionally intelligent computers, applications of affective computing and moral and social concerns that arise with it. **Part II** provides more depth discussing the design and construction of affective computers. It includes signal-based representations of emotions, human affect recognition as a pattern recognition and learning problem and the application area of affective wearable computers. Though this part is comparatively more technical than Part I, Prof. Picard has kept the explainations at a level that can be understood by a broad audience.
